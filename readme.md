# Superposition Chess

Aka Quantum Chess

On a 4x4 board:

1. Both players have 4 pieces
2. You place them all on the first row
3. **You don't need to decide which piece is which**, until the end of the game

At the end of the game, you decide which piece is which. But the pieces need
to have obeyed the normal rules.

So, if you move a piece forward 1 space, then could be the pawn or the rook or
the queen or the king.

But move it forward 4 spaces and it's either the rook or the queen.

It is a confusing game.

## It's a react project

This is really an excuse to write some fun but nontrivial react / redux code,
and see if I like it.

## Run it

Do the normal thing of:

```sh
npm ci
npm start
```

There's also a docker-compose in there for no good reason.
